<h1> Philz App </h1>

<h4> Designed and implemented a single screen app that displays information about Philz </h4>

<p>Since I love Philz so much, it was not hard to choose Philz as a business I want to design this single screen app for.
To maintain a consistent theme, I utilized only Philz colors for the app (please see color palatte below for reference).</p>

<p>HEX codes for color theme:</p>
<ul>#271714</ul>
<ul>#54845A</ul>
<ul>#C76B19</ul>
<ul>#B7A576</ul>
<ul>#F9F5E6</ul>
